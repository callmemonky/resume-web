In the time when everyone has personalized website, in these times we still leave that space empty.
I've created this project where you can change the variables according to your specifications and create your own personalized website in few minutes.

## How to?

In the project directory (..\resume-web\src\data), navigate the data folder in which all you gotta do is change the variable in data.js.

**Note: Install the dependencies using npm install**

**Feel free to send for PR for changes**
